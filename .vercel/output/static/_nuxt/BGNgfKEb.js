      `},{title:"6. COMMUNICATION WITH THE CUSTOMER",content:`
        <p>Once your turn in the waiting list arrives, I will reach out to you via email. If I don't receive a response, I will follow up with an SMS and/or WhatsApp message. If I am unable to reach you after multiple attempts through these channels, and there is no response within 60 days of the initial contact, your deposit and spot on the waiting list will unfortunately be forfeited. This policy helps maintain an efficient workflow and allows me to accommodate other clients who are eagerly waiting for their portraits.</p>
      `},{title:"7. REFUND OF DEPOSITS",content:`
        <p>Deposits are non-refundable; However, on some rare occasions they can only be refundable if the artwork/painting has not been started or done. When you book a portrait on my waiting list, you reserve a specific spot in my calendar, which prevents me from accepting other customers during that time. Every day dedicated to your booking means I am turning away other clients and substantial projects. Because your reservation directly impacts my ability to take on other work, I am unable to refund deposits.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">Also, a painting/artwork takes hours to weeks to create, once your painting/artwork has started or finished, the deposit fee cannot be refundable because a lot of work and hours has been invested into it.</p>
